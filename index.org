* Bio
I am a PhD student at ITU as part of the [[http:pls.itu.dk][Programming, Logic and
Semantics Group]]. I work on creating type systems for reactive
programming. My research interest includes reactive programming,
formal logic, category theory, formalized mathematics, constructive
mathematics and foundations of mathematics.
